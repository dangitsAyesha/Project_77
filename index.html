    <body><h1>Project on Console</h1>
    <p>I'm too lazy to write this and search it up, or use my brain so this is what we are going to go with. Wtire about visual studio and how to set it up</p>
    <p> Write about the console screen. I'm also too lazy to do this, but the console screen is where you gonna find the code below. It's also where my dad found the problem in the webiste. It allows a user to input commands and recieve visual output from a computer or computer system. Just use console log and then the stuff that you wrote will show. I know I'm smart.</p>

        var first_name = "Ayesha ";
        var last_name = "Hasni";
        var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name)
        console.log(full_name)
        var a = 34; 
        var b = 69;
        var add = a + b
        console.log(add);
        var multiplication = a*b
        console.log(multiplication)
